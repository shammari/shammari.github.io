# **Research ''Team''**
Although not formally designated as a lab, I supervise **graduate students** working on a range of projects in **mathematical modeling, dynamical systems, and computational biology**. The research conducted under my supervision generally focuses on investigating implications of structural heterogeneities on biological function.

## **Research Themes**
- **Oxygen transport & capillary networks**
- **Epidemiological modeling & disease dynamics**
- **Genotype-Phenotype maps & evolutionary constraints**
- **Public health and clinical data analysis & computational methods**

## **Current and Former Students**
### **Current Students**
- **Jumanah A. Salman** â€“ Project on [Oxygen Transport]
- **Zeinab A. Mohammad** â€“ Project on [Genotype-Phenotype Maps]
- **Haya H. Abuhasan** â€“ Project on [Epidemic Modeling]

### **Former Students**
- **Abir Aljassar** â€“ Thesis on [Epidemic Modeling], now at [Ministry of Education, Kuwait]

## **Opportunities**
I welcome inquiries from prospective **graduate students, postdocs and collaborators** interested in any of these research areas or any complimentary research themes.
